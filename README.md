## The Idea
The ability to enforce the security configuration guide. There are a few modules missing for that

## Examples Around the idea
VMware vSphere Security Configuration Guide 7 - https://core.vmware.com/vmware-vsphere-security-configuration-guide-7
 - ESXi Security Configuration
 - VM Security Configuration
 - DVS Security Configuration

Some examples how this configurations are possible:

- https://mycloudrevolution.com/en/2019/05/27/vsphere-vm-security-configuration-with-ansible/
- https://mycloudrevolution.com/en/2019/04/09/vmware-esxi-security-configuration-with-ansible/
  
80% of the configurations might be done pretty quick, the other 20% are the problem.
